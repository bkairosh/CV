    <p> Hello there! I'm an engineer with years of experience working in the
        additive manufacturing and oil industry. I'm passionate about technology,
        and very interested in programming and 3D modeling. Here I'll be publishing
        some of my projects and writting up a detailed description about the work I've
        been doing. Here you should be able to access my contents either in media format
        and should be able to download them directly. If you have any questions please
        feel free to contact me anytime.
    </p>
